## About

BlueprintStack helps people to experiment with the awesome API blueprint specification easily. No account required, multiple blueprint files, automatic preview updates and, saving your blueprints locally.

BlueprintStack is the next version of a platform known as <a href="https://blueprint-dash.surge.sh">blueprint-dash</a>. The idea behind this rewrite was that I always felt that blueprint-dash lacked some functionality that I thought it was a must have for a platform like this. Also I thought that some parts of the old playground could be rewritten with better **react** patterns.

## Features

- No account required
- Multiple blueprint files
- Automatic preview updates (while typing)
- Blueprints saved locally

## Notice

This is a playground for quick access to the spec. If you are serious about working with API blueprint for your project/product I recommend the official <a href="https://apiary.io/">apiary</a> platform by Oracle.
